         <lg n="I">
            <l>I</l>
            <l>Complacencies of the peignoir, and late</l>
            <l>Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,</l>
            <l>And the green freedom of a cockatoo</l>
            <l>Upon a rug, mingle to dissipate</l>
            <l>The holy hush of ancient sacrifice.</l>
            <l>She dreams a little, and she feels the dark</l>
            <l>Encroachment of that old catastrophe,</l>
            <l>As a calm darkens among water-lights.</l>
            <l>The pungent oranges and bright, green wings</l>
            <l>Seem things in some procession of the dead,</l>
            <l>Winding across wide water, without sound.</l>
            <l>The day is like wide water, without sound,</l>
            <l>Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet</l>
            <l>Over the seas, to silent Palestine,</l>
            <l>Dominion of the blood and sepulcher.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg n="II">
            <l>II</l>
            <l>She hears, upon that water without sound,</l>
            <l>A voice that cries, “The tomb in Palestine</l>
            <l>Is not the porch of spirits lingering;</l>
            <l>It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.”</l>
            <l>We live in an old chaos of the sun,</l>
            <l>Or old dependency of day and night,</l>
            <l>Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,</l>
            <l>Of that wide water, inescapable.</l>
            <l>Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail</l>
            <l>Whistle about us their spontaneous cries;</l>
            <l>Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;</l>
            <l>And, in the isolation of the sky,</l>
            <l>At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make</l>
            <l>Ambiguous undulations as they sink,</l>
            <l>Downward to darkness, on extended wings.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg n="III">
            <l>III</l>
            <l>She says, “I am content when wakened birds,</l>
            <l>Before they fly, test the reality</l>
            <l>Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings;</l>
            <l>But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields</l>
            <l>Return no more, where, then, is paradise?”</l>
            <l>There is not any haunt of prophesy,</l>
            <l>Nor any old chimera of the grave,</l>
            <l>Neither the golden underground, nor isle</l>
            <l>Melodious, where spirits gat them home,</l>
            <l>Nor visionary South, nor cloudy palm</l>
            <l>Remote on heaven’s hill, that has endured</l>
            <l>As April’s green endures; or will endure</l>
            <l>Like her remembrance of awakened birds,</l>
            <l>Or her desire for June and evening, tipped</l>
            <l>By the consummation of the swallow’s wings.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg n="IV">
            <l>IV</l>
            <l>She says, “But in contentment I still feel</l>
            <l>The need of some imperishable bliss.”</l>
            <l>Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,</l>
            <l>Alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreams</l>
            <l>And our desires.  Although she strews the leaves</l>
            <l>Of sure obliteration on our paths—</l>
            <l>The path sick sorrow took, the many paths</l>
            <l>Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love</l>
            <l>Whispered a little out of tenderness—</l>
            <l>She makes the willow shiver in the sun</l>
            <l>For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze</l>
            <l>Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet.</l>
            <l>She causes boys to bring sweet-smelling pears</l>
            <l>And plums in ponderous piles.  The maidens taste</l>
            <l>And stray impassioned in the littering leaves.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg n="V">
            <l>V</l>
            <l>Supple and turbulent, a ring of men</l>
            <l>Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn</l>
            <l>Their boisterous devotion to the sun—</l>
            <l>Not as a god, but as a god might be,</l>
            <l>Naked among them, like a savage source.</l>
            <l>Their chant shall be a chant of paradise,</l>
            <l>Out of their blood, returning to the sky;</l>
            <l>And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice,</l>
            <l>The windy lake wherein their lord delights,</l>
            <l>The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills,</l>
            <l>That choir among themselves long afterward.</l>
            <l>They shall know well the heavenly fellowship</l>
            <l>Of men that perish and of summer morn—</l>
            <l>And whence they came and whither they shall go,</l>
            <l>The dew upon their feet shall manifest.</l>
